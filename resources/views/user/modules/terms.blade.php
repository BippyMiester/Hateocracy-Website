<!-- Welcome -->
<h2 id="welcome">Welcome and Contact</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Hateocracy Privacy Policy. In this policy we explain in plain terms how we collect, use, process, and share information about you. Please read this policy carefully so you can decide what information you choose to share with us. If you have any questions about this policy or our handling of your personal information, contact us through Discord at <a href="https://discord.hateocracy.com/">https://discord.hateocracy.com/</a> and open a support ticket.</p>
<!-- 1. Summary -->
<h2 id="overview">1. Company Overview and Scope</h2>
<p>Hateocracy (called “Hateocracy,” “us,” or “we”) is a limited liability company formed under Pennsylvania law and headquartered in Pennsylvania. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) covers our website at https://hateocracy.com/ (the “Website”), our advertising on various platforms, and other services we may offer from time to time. Some services may have their own privacy notices, which will be available inside those services or in other appropriate places. Together we call our Website, advertising, and any other offerings our “Services.”</p>
<p>This Policy is an agreement between Hateocracy and you, the user of our Services (called “you”). It explains when it applies, what information we collect and why, how you can review or change personal information you gave us, how we may change this Policy, and the steps we take to protect your personal data.</p>
<!-- 2. Consent -->
<h2 id="acceptance">2. Acceptance of Policy and License</h2>
<p>IMPORTANT: By downloading, installing, accessing, using, or otherwise interacting with our Website or Services, you accept the terms of this Policy and our End User License Agreement, including how we collect and process personal information. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, do not provide personal information; stop using the Website immediately; do not download, install, access, or use our Services; and promptly remove our content from your devices.</p>
<!-- 3. Effective Date -->
<h2 id="effective">3. Policy Effective Date and Updates</h2>
<p>This Policy takes effect on December 30, 2025 and remains in force except where specific parts are changed later, in which case those changes take effect on the date we post them on the Website or otherwise notify you as may be required by law. We may update this Policy at any time and reserve the right to do so. All changes, additions, or deletions become effective when posted on this site.</p>
<p>Please review this Policy periodically since its terms may change without prior notice. If you continue to use the Services after changes are posted, your continued use means you accept the updated Policy and agree to be bound by it. We will revise the “last updated” date at the top of this Policy whenever we post changes.</p>
<!-- 4. Types of information -->
<h2 id="collection">4. Types of Information Collected</h2>
<p>We collect information from various sources, but most comes directly from you when you interact with our Website, advertising, or Services. Generally, the data we collect relates to the device you use and how you access our Services.</p>
<p><strong>Further Details:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Website.</strong> You do not have to provide personally identifiable information just to visit the Website unless you choose to use features that require it, such as the “Contact Us” page.</p>
<!-- 5. Children -->
<h2 id="children">5. Children’s Privacy Notice</h2>
<p>Hateocracy is committed to protecting children’s privacy and does not intend to collect personal data from anyone under 18. We encourage parents and guardians to regularly monitor their children’s email and online activity.</p>
<p>Please note our Services are for a general audience and are not aimed specifically at children under 13. We respect the special privacy needs of children online. If we learn or have reason to believe a user is under 13, we will promptly delete any personal information about that user.</p>
<p>By accepting these terms, you confirm you are at least 13 years old.</p>
<!-- 6. Security (rewritten & expanded) -->
<h2 id="security">6. Website Security & Protection</h2>
<p>This section applies only to the Website and describes the technical and organizational steps we use to protect information. While no system is entirely risk-free, we take reasonable measures to reduce risks and protect data from unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, or misuse.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Encryption in transit: We use industry-standard TLS/SSL to encrypt data sent between your browser and our Website where supported.</li>
    <li>Access controls: Access to personal data is limited to employees and contractors who need it to perform their duties and who are bound by confidentiality obligations.</li>
    <li>Administrative safeguards: We maintain policies and procedures (such as password management and least-privilege access) designed to limit internal exposure to personal information.</li>
    <li>Data backups and retention: We maintain backups to preserve data integrity and to restore systems after failures, and we retain information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy.</li>
    <li>Incident response: We maintain processes to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents. If a material breach affects your personal information, we will comply with applicable notification requirements.</li>
    <li>Third-party limitations: We do not engage in vulnerability or malware scanning on third-party systems on your behalf, and we do not perform PCI-standard scanning. We also do not permit third-party behavioral tracking on the Website. We have not enabled Google AdSense but may do so in the future.</li>
</ul>
<!-- 7. Risk -->
<h2 id="interception">7. Risk of Interception</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that any time you share personal information online there is a risk that third parties may intercept and use it. While Hateocracy works to protect your personal data and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of information you disclose online. By using any Service, you acknowledge and agree we cannot guarantee data security and that any information you provide is given at your own risk, which you accept.</p>
<!-- 8. Sharing (rewritten & expanded) -->
<h2 id="sharing">8. When We Share Your Information</h2>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> We disclose personal information only when necessary: with your consent, to comply with the law or protect safety, or to perform business functions such as hosting, analytics, or advertising. See the advertising and tracking sections below for more detail on ad-related sharing.</p>
<p><strong>Further Details:</strong></p>
<p><strong>LAW, SAFETY, AND ENFORCEMENT.</strong> We may release personal or other information without your consent when required by law, a court order, or a valid subpoena, or when we reasonably believe disclosure is necessary to prevent physical harm, fraud, damage to property, or other illegal activity. We cooperate with law enforcement and may respond to requests from authorities in jurisdictions inside or outside the United States as required by applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS AND SERVICE PARTNERS.</strong> Some Services are delivered through contracts with affiliates, hosting providers, analytics vendors, advertising partners, and other service providers (“Service Partners”). Service Partners that process your data do so only to perform agreed tasks and must keep that information confidential. Examples include website hosting, email delivery, payment processors, and ad networks. Their use of your information is governed by their privacy policies and contractual commitments with us.</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY-BASED DISCLOSURES.</strong> In limited circumstances—such as to investigate or respond to suspected abuse or fraud—we may disclose data without your consent. Decisions to disclose information for security reasons are made by us in good faith and in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>CONSENT.</strong> We may also share personal information for other purposes when you have explicitly agreed to that sharing, for example by opting into a partner service.</p>
<!-- 9. Links -->
<h2 id="links">9. External Links</h2>
<p>We may include links to third-party websites in the Website and our Services. This Policy does not cover those third-party sites. Links take you outside our Services and are beyond our control. This can include partner sites that use Hateocracy branding as part of co-branding.</p>
<p>Those linked sites have their own privacy policies. Although we try to protect the integrity of our Website, Hateocracy is not responsible for the content or activities on those sites. Visiting those sites is at your own risk. Those sites may set their own cookies, collect data, or ask for personal information.</p>
<!-- 10. Tracking (partial rewritten to reflect no games) -->
<h2 id="tracking">10. Ad IDs, Cookies & Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> To operate our Website and Services and to support interest-based advertising, we use ad identifiers, cookies, and similar technologies. Read this section to understand what these tools are, how we use them, and how you can manage your preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Further Details:</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT THEY ARE.</strong> Ad identifiers are temporary, non-personal codes assigned to a device. Similar tools include tracking pixels embedded in ads or pages. These technologies let companies (including advertisers) recognize a device when it accesses websites and applications.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small piece of text a website stores on your device to identify that device or remember preferences. Cookies can record how you use the Website and help us improve functionality and user experience. Cookies may also remember a user name or other settings if you enable those features.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE USE THEM.</strong> We and our advertising partners use ad identifiers, cookies, and similar technologies to provide and improve our Website and Services and to collect information from devices. These tools allow us and our partners to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>recognize you and your device;</li>
    <li>deliver interest-based advertising;</li>
    <li>enable the Website or Service to integrate with a social platform or other third-party feature when you choose to enable it;</li>
    <li>provide more relevant language, regional settings, and other customized experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TURNING OFF COOKIES.</strong> You cannot turn off cookies via our Website; if you do not want cookies used, do not use the Website.</p>
<p>If you live in the USA, Europe, or Canada, you can opt out of some ad partners’ data collection through the Digital Advertising Alliance at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> (US), <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a> (EU), or <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/choices">http://youradchoices.ca/choices</a> (Canada). You can also click the AdChoices logo in an ad where available. Opting out may reduce the relevance of ads you see and may limit some features of our Services.</p>
<p>Please note opting out does not stop all ads; it only makes ads less tailored. We may still use your device’s ad identifier for purposes such as frequency capping (limiting how often you see the same ad).</p>
<!-- 11. Opt-out -->
<h2 id="optout">11. Opt-Out Rights</h2>
<p>To stop all collection of information from the Website, you must leave and stop using the Website.</p>
<!-- 12. Deleting -->
<h2 id="modify">12. Change or Delete Your Data</h2>
<p>If you want to access, change, or delete personal information that identifies you, contact us via Discord at <a href="https://discord.hateocracy.com/">https://discord.hateocracy.com/</a> and open a ticket. Include your Discord user ID. Without that ID we cannot process deletion requests.</p>
<p>You must contact us from the same Discord account you want removed. This requirement helps protect your security and confirm you are the account owner.</p>
<!-- 13. Contact -->
<h2 id="contact">13. Contact</h2>
<p><a href="https://discord.hateocracy.com/">https://discord.hateocracy.com/</a></p>
<!-- 14. License & Terms -->
<h2 id="license">14. License, Use Limits, and Legal Terms</h2>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE LICENSE TERMS CAREFULLY.</strong></p>
<p>BY CLICKING THE “I AGREE” BUTTON, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND THEY BIND YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT CLICK “I AGREE” AND LEAVE THE WEBSITE IMMEDIATELY.</p>
<p>You agree Hateocracy may ban a player from the Website or specific features if we find the user abusing exploits, cheats, hacks, or harassing others. Reasons for bans are decided case by case and at Hateocracy’s discretion.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for external sites the Website links to. The Website may include links to independent sites not provided by us. Those sites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for their content or privacy practices. You must decide independently whether to use those sites or buy their products or services.</p>
<p><strong>Our responsibility for loss or damage you suffer.</strong> We are not liable for business losses. The Website is provided for domestic and private use. If you use the Website for commercial purposes, we are not liable for lost profits, lost business, business interruption, or lost business opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of the Website.</strong> The Website is for information and entertainment only and does not offer professional advice you should rely on. Obtain professional advice before acting or failing to act based on Website content. Although we attempt to keep Website information updated, we give no warranties or guarantees that it is accurate, complete, or current.</p>
<p><strong>Events beyond our control.</strong> If events outside our control delay support for the Website, we will notify you as soon as possible and take steps to reduce the delay’s effect. If we do this we will not be liable for delay-related losses. If a substantial delay occurs, you may contact us to end your contract and receive a refund for inability to use the Website.</p>
<p>We may end your right to use the App if you breach these terms. We may terminate your access if you seriously break the terms and will, where reasonable, give you an opportunity to fix the breach.</p>
<p>If we end your rights to use the Website and Services:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You must stop all activities allowed by these terms, including use of the Website.</li>
    <li>You must delete or remove the Website from all devices you control and destroy all copies, then confirm to us you have done so.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may transfer this agreement to another organization. We will inform you in writing if that happens and ensure the transfer does not affect your rights under the contract.</p>
<p>You need our written consent to transfer your rights or obligations to someone else.</p>
<p>If a court finds any part of this contract illegal, the rest will remain in force. Each paragraph stands separately; if a court or authority rules any paragraph unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will stay effective.</p>
<p>Even if we delay enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not immediately insist you follow something required by these terms, or delay action for a breach, that does not stop us from enforcing the term later.</p>
<p>Governing law and legal proceedings: These terms are governed by United States law and you may bring legal proceedings in U.S. courts regarding the products and Services.</p>
